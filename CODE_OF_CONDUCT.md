# Code of conduct

Be kind. Also be brave. But if you cannot be brave, at least be kind.

This project aspires to be an organism in the [Apereo] [uPortal] ecosystem. Were this project formally in the context of uPortal, the [Apereo Welcoming Policy] would necessarily apply.

It's not clear that this project is currently under the auspices of Apereo, so it's not presently clear that the Apereo Welcoming Policy applies.

Please be kind in your participation in this project. If participants are unkind the maintainers will have to figure out what to do about it, and that's not likely to be much fun for anyone.
