# Committers

This project aspires to be a free and open source software project in the uPortal ecosystem.

For purposes of bootstrapping such a viable open source software project, the Committers are

+ Andrew Petro ( @apetro )
+ Doug Reed ( @Doug-Reed )
+ David Sibley ( @davidmsibley )
+ Tim Vertein ( @vertein )

With progress towards bootstrapping this project into a collaborative open source software project context, we might be able to simplify the Committers definition on this project to a reference to Committers on a parent project.
